lattice.ipynb : basics informations about the CaCN2 lattice (vectors, reciprocal network, lattice type, etc)

symmetry.ipynb : analysis of the symmetry about the CaCN2 lattice. You'll find the jsmol, if it's not visible on Git, in the JsmolSym√©tries file

xrd.ipynb : analysis of diffraction peaks of CaCN2

el_bands : analysis of the electronic bands and the band gap of CaCN2

ph_bands : analysis of the bands of phonon of CaCN2

ph_dos : analysis of the density of phonon of CaCN2
